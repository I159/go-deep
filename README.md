# GO DEEP

## Motivation

This is my personal education project. Things I want to train and learn with this project: AI deep learning basics, Go IoC architecture approaches, Go programs performance optimization and profiling. The goal is to assemble a flexible and efficient deep learning framework on pure Go.

## Installation

`go get github.com/I159/go_deep`

And if you need examples to play with there is a sample project with examples for the library.

`go get github.com/I159/go_deep_examples`

## Contribution

If you have the same goals of learning or/and you have more solid math or architectural background than me feel free to fork and make pull requests.

## Current state of the project

Perceptron (aka dense neural network) is implemented with ability to add different activation and cost functions.
